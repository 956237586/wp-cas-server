This plugin allows WordPress to act as a single sign-on authenticator using versions 1.0 and 2.0 of the Central Authentication Service protocol.

That way, users on your WordPress install may be able to access different applications that support the CAS protocol while providing a single set of credentials, once only and without exposing the user's password.
